1. Project goals:
   - the goal of this simple game is to make points by calculating math tasks;
   - you determine the input, the computer determines the task;
   - you have the following options:
      a) a + b;
      b) a - b;
      c) a * b;
   - if you answer correct, you earn points;
   - if you answer incorrect, you lose the game.

2. Solution:
   - The player enters two numbers 'a' and 'b';
   - The player cannot enter symbols or charachers. He can only enter number (the program checks this);
   - After that the computer gives the player a task which can be one of the following:

   a + b = ... ?
   a - b = ... ?
   a * b = ... ?
   
   - If the players answers correct, he earns points;
   - If he does not, he loses the game;
